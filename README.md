## LangChain Projects — AI Engineering

This repository contains my LangChain based projects and experiments notebooks built while learning **Generative AI Engineering** using OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic models.

### LangChain Projects and Experimentation

- Experimented with Langchain using OpenAI
- Experimented with Langchain using Gemini
- Langchain Implementation: LLM Chaining, PromptTemplates, Tools
- Langchain Tools: DuckDuckGoSearch, WikipediaSearch
- Project: Langchain React Agent using - Langchain Tools (PythonREPL for coding and calculations, DuckDuckGo for Web Search and Wikipedia for factual details), OpenAI GPT Model as LLM, hwchase17 react from Langchain hub.
- Performed Embeddings on csv files, estimated cost for tokens using TikToken and used OpenAI API Embedding Models, performed Semantic searches using custom Cosine Similarity
- Project: RAG Based Project "Question-Answering System on Private Documents" using OpenAI, Pinecone, Chroma and Langchain
