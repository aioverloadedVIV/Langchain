      "GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI and the fifth in its series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models. Preceded in the series by GPT-4, it was launched on August 7, 2025, combining reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface. At its time of release, GPT-5 had state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The model is publicly accessible to users of the chatbot products ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 14, 2023, Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, spoke at an event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and said that the company was not training GPT-5 at that time. He stated that OpenAI was \"prioritizing GPT-4 development\" and that \"we are not and won't for some time\" release GPT-5.\n",
      "On July 18, OpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States. On November 13, Altman confirmed to the Financial Times that the company was working to develop GPT-5.\n",
      "According to The Information, \"[f]or much of the second half of 2024, OpenAI was developing a model known internally as Orion and intended to become GPT-5\", \"[b]ut the Orion effort failed to produce a better model, and the company instead released it as GPT-4.5 in February [2025].\"\n",
      "By late July 2025, OpenAI was widely anticipated as planning to release GPT-5 in early August. On July 30, The Verge reported that \"Microsoft is getting ready for GPT-5\" as \"sources familiar with Microsoft's AI plans\" told an editor that the company was testing a new mode for its Copilot chatbot that would offer a model that \"thinks deeply or quickly based on the task\". On August 5, in the leadup to the release of GPT-5, OpenAI released GPT-OSS, a set of two open-weight models that have reasoning capabilities. GPT-5 was then unveiled during a livestream event on August 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Capabilities ==\n",
      "At the time of its release, GPT-5 had state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks that test mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. According to OpenAI, improvements over its predecessor models include faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and lower levels of hallucination. Also, compared to previous models, GPT-5 aims to give safe, high-level responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them, an approach that OpenAI refers to as \"safe completions\", aiming to result \"in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.\" In addition, GPT-5 was trained to give more critical, \"less effusively agreeable\" answers compared to its predecessor models.\n",
      "Days before the launch of GPT-5, two early testers of the model stated that they were \"impressed\" by its ability to code and to solve mathematical and scientific problems. They suggested that the model shows great improvement from GPT-4, but not as large of a gain as from GPT-3 to GPT-4. A day prior to the release of GPT-5, during a press briefing, Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, called GPT-5 \"a significant step along the path to AGI\", referring to artificial general intelligence, the hypothetical level of intelligence that OpenAI defines as the ability to perform any economically valuable task that a human can. According to Altman, GPT-5 is \"significantly better\" than its predecessors, offering \"PhD-level\" abilities across a wide range of tasks.\n",
      "The exact energy consumption of GPT-5 use has not been disclosed by OpenAI. Researchers at the University of Rhode Island estimated that a medium-length response consumes slightly over 18 watt-hours, equivalent to using an incandescent bulb for 18 minutes.\n",

      "OpenAI, Inc. ist ein US-amerikanisches nicht-börsennotiertes Softwareunternehmen, das sich seit Ende 2015 mit der Erforschung von künstlicher Intelligenz (KI, englisch Artificial Intelligence, AI) beschäftigt. Anfänglich war das Ziel von OpenAI, künstliche Intelligenz auf Open-Source-Basis zu entwickeln. Das Unternehmen wurde vorerst als Non-Profit geführt. 2019 wurde die gewinnorientierte Tochtergesellschaft OpenAI Global, LLC gegründet, in der Microsoft größter Investor ist. OpenAI ist vor allem bekannt für die Entwicklung der generativen vortrainierten Transformer (GPT) – auch generative künstliche Intelligenz, kurz GenAI, bezeichnet – und der daraus abgeleiteten Softwareprodukte wie ChatGPT oder DALL-E.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Gründungsphase und Mission ===\n",
      "Der Gründung von OpenAI im Jahr 2015 ging bereits eine lange Debatte um die Risiken von KI voraus. Die Wissenschaftler Stephen Hawking und Stuart Jonathan Russell etwa hatten Befürchtungen geäußert, wenn künstliche Intelligenz eines Tages die Fähigkeit erlangen könnte, sich selbst zu verbessern, dies zu einer Explosion der Intelligenz führen könnte. Durch die damit einhergehende Überlegenheit der KI sei eine Verdrängung der Spezies Mensch durch superintelligente künstliche Intelligenz denkbar, die keinen menschlichen Wertvorstellungen unterworfen ist.\n",
      "Um Risiken wie diesen bei der Entwicklung künstlicher Intelligenz entgegenzutreten, wurde Open AI, Inc. als Open-Source-Non-Profit-Organisation in der Rechtsform einer Public Charity (501(c), Nonprofit) konzipiert. Damit sollte die Unabhängigkeit der Organisation gegenüber Geldgebern und deren Interessen sichergestellt werden; für die Forschung sollte der Freiraum geschaffen werden, sich auf lange Sicht positiv auf die Gesellschaft auswirken zu können. Die Organisation wollte eine „freie Zusammenarbeit“ mit anderen Institutionen und Forschern ermöglichen, indem sie ihre Patente und Forschungsergebnisse für die Öffentlichkeit zugänglich mache.\n",
      "Gegründet wurde OpenAI von einer Gruppe von KI- und IT-Experten, darunter als bekannteste Personen Sam Altman (zuvor unter anderem bei Y Combinator tätig), Greg Brockman, ehemaliger Chefentwickler von Stripe, der Multiunternehmer Elon Musk und Ilya Sutskever, ein ehemaliger Experte von Google für Maschinelles Lernen. Open AI, Inc. wurde ursprünglich ausschließlich durch Spenden finanziert. Die Initiative hatte von Beginn an sehr prominente Unterstützer mit Reid Hoffman, Mitbegründer von LinkedIn,\n",
      "Peter Thiel, Mitbegründer von PayPal, Jessica Livingston, eine Gründungspartnerin von Y Combinator, Amazon Web Services und Infosys Technologies.\n",
      "Das Unternehmen OpenAI selbst äußerte 2015, dass schwer abzuschätzen sei, wie sehr die Gesellschaft von hochwertiger künstlicher Intelligenz profitieren könnte. Genauso komplex sei zu eruieren, welchen Schaden eine missbräuchliche Verwendung dieser Technologie mit sich bringen könnte. Es sei nicht absehbar, wann künstliche Intelligenz auf dem Niveau sein werde, mit der menschlichen Intelligenz in Konkurrenz zu treten. Der Vorstand von OpenAI sagte 2015, künstliche Intelligenz sei eine Erweiterung des individuellen menschlichen Willens. Damit sollte diese Technologie auch flächendeckend verfügbar und jedem Menschen im gleichen Maße zugänglich sein. Das erklärte Fernziel von OpenAI ist die Entwicklung einer künstlichen allgemeinen Intelligenz (Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)), einer fortgeschrittenen Form der KI, die in der Lage sein soll, intellektuelle Aufgaben nicht nur auf einem menschenähnlichen, sondern potenziell darüber hinaus gehenden Niveau zu bewältigen. Ein Übertreffen der menschlichen Intelligenz durch das auf mehrere Jahrzehnte konzipierte Projekt OpenAI ist für den Vorsitzenden des Unternehmens, Sam Altman, jedenfalls denkbar.\n",
      "Vishal Sikka, 2014 bis 2017 Vorstandsvorsitzender von Infosys, schrieb 2015, es sei wichtig, dass die OpenAI-Forschung „the greater good“ – das Wohl der Allgemeinheit – anstrebe. Cade Metz von Wired sagte, \n"
